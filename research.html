<h2>Tube-based planning and control under uncertainties</h2>
<p>Motion planning and tracking control for robotic and autonomous systems with nonlinear, underactuated and uncertain dynamics-with guaranteed safety-remains a challenging problem. In this project, we developed tracking controllers with transient performance guarantees for general nonlinear systems subject to model uncertainties. The tracking controllers can be conveniently incorporated into a feedback motion planning framework for planning safety-guaranteed trajectories. Our methods are based on control contraction metrics (CCMs) recently proposed for the synthesis of nonlinear controllers using convex optimization. Our specific contributions are as follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances, we proposed robust CCMs that minimize the effect of disturbances on nominal-actual trajectory deviations while yielding certificate tubes for quantifying the deviations for both states and inputs,
</p>
</li>
<li><p>For nonlinear systems subject to matched (time- and state-dependent) uncertainties, we proposed a disturbance estimation-based CCM controller that ensures exponential convergence of the actual state trajectory to its nominal counterpart in the presence of matched uncertainties.

<h2>Safe and robust learning-enabled control via active uncertainty compensation</h2>
<p>In this project, we explore the integration of machine learning (ML) and control theory for safe and robust learning-enabled control. In particular, we are interested in leveraging adaptive or disturbance observer-based control to <i>actively compensate for the uncertainties</i> that may be induced by environmental change (in a model-free setting) or the inaccuracy of the learned dynamics (in a model-based setting).  This uncertain compensation based approach enables fast reaction to sudden dynamics change and less conservative control performance in the presence of a poorly learned dynamics model compared to robust approaches without uncertainty compensation.

<h2>Adaptive geometric control of quadrotors</h2>
<p>Quadrotors have been widely used in various applications such as environment monitoring, structure inspection, emergency response, and package delivery. Precise control of quadrotors is very challenging in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances from various sources, such as aerodynamic drag, unknown payload, and wind/gust.  In this project, we proposed an adaptive geometric controller based on \(\mathcal L_1\) adaptive augmentation of a geometric controller, which provides guaranteed tracking performance in the presence of a broad class of uncertainties. We experimentally validated the performance of the controller on a custom-built quadrotor platform.

<h2>Adaptive control of aerospace systems</h2>
<p>Motivated by the need to adjust the desired dynamics in the control of aerospace systems, we developed adaptive controllers that allow the desired dynamics to be systematically scheduled or switched, e.g., according to the operating conditions. The developed adaptive controllers utilize the \(\mathcal L_1\) adaptive control architecture that has been tested on many safety-critical systems, including piloted and unmanned aircraft, and incorporate LPV and switching systems to characterize the desired dynamics.  
In particular, for LPV systems subject to unmatched uncertainties,  we proposed a novel approach based on peak-to-peak gain minimization and analysis from robust control to mitigate the effect of unmatched uncertainties, while allowing for the controllers to provide transient performance guarantees. Additionally, the adaptive controller with switched desired dynamics was used to facilitate safe real-time learning of aerial vehicle dynamics and tested on a UAV.

<h2>Intelligent agricultural management with reinforcement learning</h2>
<p>The world's agricultural system is facing significant challenges to bridge the gap between the amount of food produced today and that needed to feed a population of 9.6 billion by 2050 while reducing environmental impacts. In this project, we envisioned an intelligent agricultural management system based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulations (e.g., using DSSAT), which can improve crop yields while reducing the use of resources (e.g., fertilizers, irrigation water) compared to expert-suggested management practices. We also leveraged imitation learning (IL) to train practically-implementable management policies that use only the state information that is easily accessible in the real world.
