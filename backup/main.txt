My current research focus on *control* and *autonomy*. In particular, I work on developing robust, adaptive and nonlinear control algorithms (with machine learning-enabled elements) to ensure safe and efficient operation of aerospace, robotic and autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. I am also interested in applying machine learning to optimize agricultural management for sustainable and resilient agriculture. Specific projects that I have been working on include
- Integrated planning and control for robotic and autonomous systems with nonlinear and uncertain dynamics
- Safe and robust learning-enabled control via active uncertainty compensation
- Adaptive control of aerospace systems under time-varying desired dynamics 
- Integrated adaptive control and reference governors for constrained control of uncertain systems
- Intelligent agricultural management with reinforcement learning
- Robust and gain-scheduled control with application to mechatronic systems
