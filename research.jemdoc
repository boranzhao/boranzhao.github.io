== Adaptive control for Learn-to-Fly
Learn-to-Fly  aims to reduce or eliminate the need for ground-based aero-dynamic modeling in favor of in-flight modeling and control law determination. At the initial stage of the model learning process, large uncertainties inevitably exist. To stabilize the aerial vehicles in the presence of the large uncertainties, we leverage and extend the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control architecture to allow for switched nominal/desired dynamics, as a result of periodic update of the learned model. The framework is validated by flight tests on UAVs.

== Robust and gain-scheduled control of miniaturized optical image stabilizers (OISs)
In this project, robust and gain-scheduled control methods are explored for miniaturized optical image stabilizers to deal with the inevitable product variations. These methods were experimentally validated on both large-scale and small-scale prototypes.
