== About me 
I am an Assistant Professor in the [https://aem.eng.ua.edu/ Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics] at the [https://www.ua.edu/ University of Alabama]. Before joining UA, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [https://mechse.illinois.edu/ Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering] at the [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign], advised by Prof. [http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/ Naira Hovakimyan]. I got my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from the [https://www.ubc.ca/ University of British Columbia], advised by Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/ryozo-nagamune/ Ryozo Nagamune] and Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/mu-chiao/ Mu Chiao].\n\n

My research interests include *control*, *autonomous systems*, and *machine learning*. Some specific directions that I currently focus on include
- Data-driven modeling and control 
- Safe reinforcement learning
- Robust and adaptive control 
- Resilient autonomous systems  
- Applications in urban air mobility, remote sensing, and drone delivery
- Intelligent agricultural management 

# I received a B.E. and M.E. in 2009 and 2012, respectively, from [https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/ Beihang University], under the supervision of Prof. [http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/wangshaoping/index.htm Shaoping Wang]. I was a visiting student in the [https://all.cs.umass.edu/ Autonomous Learning Laboratory] at the [https://www.umass.edu/ University of Massachusetts Amherst], advised by Prof. [https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/ Philip S. Thomas]. From 2012 to 2013, I was a modeling & simulation engineer at [http://www.hirain.com/ Hirain Technologies].  #I did an internship at Siemens Corporate Technology, Princeton, NJ, in 2017. During my Ph.D. program, I received the [https://vanier.gc.ca/en/home-accueil.html Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship].
