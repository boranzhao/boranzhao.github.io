== About me 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [https://mechse.illinois.edu/ Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering] at the [https://illinois.edu/ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign], advised by Prof. [http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/ Naira Hovakimyan]. I got my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 2018 from the [https://www.ubc.ca/ University of British Columbia], advised by Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/ryozo-nagamune/ Ryozo Nagamune] and Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/mu-chiao/ Mu Chiao]. I recieved a B.E. and M.E. in 2009 and 2012, respectively, from [https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/ Beihang University], under the supervision of Prof. [http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/wangshaoping/index.htm Shaoping Wang]. From 2012 to 2013, I was a modeling & simulation engineer in [http://www.hirain.com/ Hirain Technologies]. 

== Research
My current research focus on *control* and *autonomy*. In particular, I work on developing robust, adaptive and nonlinear control algorithms (with machine learning-enabled elements) to ensure safe and efficient operation of aerospace, robotic and autonomous systems in dynamic and uncertain environments. I am also interested in applying machine learning to optimize agricultural management for sustainable and resilient agriculture. Specific projects that I have been working on include
- Integrated planning and control for robotic and autonomous systems with nonlinear and uncertain dynamics
- Safe and robust learning-enabled control via active uncertainty compensation
- Adaptive control of aerospace systems under time-varying desired dynamics 
- Integrated adaptive control and reference governors for constrained control of uncertain systems
- Intelligent agricultural management with reinforcement learning
- Robust and gain-scheduled control with application to mechatronic systems
