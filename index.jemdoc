== About me 
I am a postdoc in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/ Naira Hovakimyan]. From 2013 to 2018, I was a PhD student in the [http://cel.mech.ubc.ca/ Control Engineering Lab] at the University of British Columbia, where I was supervised by Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/ryozo-nagamune/ Ryozo Nagamune] and Prof. [https://mech.ubc.ca/mu-chiao/ Mu Chiao]. I have also been very fortunate to work with Prof. [http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/wangshaoping/index.htm Shaoping Wang] during my master's studies at Beihang University from 2008 to 2013. In 2018, I had a short yet pleasant experience of working with Prof. [https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/ Philip S. Thomas] as a visiting student. Before starting my Ph.D. study, I was a modeling & simulation engineer in [http://www.hirain.com/ Hirain Technologies]. 

== Research Interests 
My research interests include *control*, *autonomy* and *sustainability*.  In particular, I am interested in developing robust/adaptive and learning-enabled control algorithms to ensure safe and efficient operation of autonomous systems in uncertain environments. I am also interested in applying control and machine learning techniques for sustainable agriculture and mitigation of climate change.
